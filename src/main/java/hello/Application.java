// @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
//
// @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
// @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings,
//                           other beans, and various property settings.
//                           For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath,
//                           this annotation flags the application as a web application and
//                           activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
// @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, letting it find the controllers.
//
// The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application.
// Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either.
// This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

// There is also a CommandLineRunner method marked as a @Bean and this runs on start up.
// It retrieves all the beans that were created either by your app or were automatically added thanks to Spring Boot.
// It sorts them and prints them out.
